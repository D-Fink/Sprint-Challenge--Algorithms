#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) since how many times this function runs depends on n it would increase linearly


b) O(n^2) since this snippet has two loops that depend on n it would increase quadratically


c) O(n) since this function relies on n until reaching zero it would increase linearly

## Exercise II

Take n floors and divide it in half. If egg breaks, return True. repeat until if egg breaks returns False. values below will be safe.
as this is a binary search it would have O(log n) time complexity
